## TServer
The easiest way to install `tserver` is download it from our [Release](https://github.com/qnkhuat/tstream/releases) page

Or if you prefer to build from source
- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/qnkhuat/tstream`
- Install the [Go toolchain](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Run `cd tstream/tstream && go run cmd/server`

Optional configurations:
- `-host localhost:3000`: Address to server tserver. Default is `localhost:3000`
- `-db .db`: path to BoltDB file. This DB is used to store data like: finished streaming. Default is `$(pwd)/.db`

Test the server with `curl http://localhost:3000/api/health`. It should return the current time

## Client web app
This is what currently running at [tstream.club](https://tstream.club). 

To run it:
- Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/qnkhuat/tstream`
- cd to the client folder: `cd client/`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Tell the client your the server address by: `export REACT_APP_API_URL={your server address}`
- Run server: `npm run start`

Now go to `localhost:3001`, it should be exactly like [tstream.club](https://tstream.club)

For production I recommend using service like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It's free and very easy to setup

## Streaming 

By default the tstream package will stream to [https://server.tstream.club](https://server.tstream.club)

You can override it with by running `tstream -server {your server address}`. 

For example : `tstream -server http://localhost:3000`
